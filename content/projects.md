**[ ü¶Ä Rust ‚Ä¢ [Homepage][findstream_home] ‚Ä¢ [Repository][findstream_repo] ]**

Findstream is a better search for [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) that allows to search directly in
stream titles. This doesn't matter for specific games but is very helpful for variety categories
like _Art_ or _Science & Technology_ where many different kind of stream are grouped together in a
single category.

For example, you can search for _Rust_ in _Science & Technology_ with this project, allowing you to
filter within the category itself which Twitch doesn't support currently.

## üó≥ Veto

[veto_repo]: https://github.com/dnaka91/veto

**[ ü¶Ä Rust ‚Ä¢ [Repository][veto_repo] ]**

Veto is a log file based IP blocker that runs as a service on the system, tracks one or more log
files and blocks IPs based on the log lines and rules defined by the user.

I started with this project as I was using fail2ban previously but noticed during load tests that it
took about 60% of my server's CPU and I wanted something more lean and fast.

## üß± Ipwall

[ipwall_repo]: https://github.com/dnaka91/ipwall

**[ ü¶Ä Rust ‚Ä¢ [Repository][ipwall_repo] ]**

Ipwall is a very simple tool to download a selection of IP blacklists and apply them to your
_iptables/ipset_ rules. It uses the [FireHOL](https://iplists.firehol.org/) level 1-3 blacklists but
can be configured to include additional lists as well.

It is meant as a companion to [Veto](#ballot-box-veto) to apply common bad IP blocks in addition to
the dynamic blocking of it.

**M**ark**D**own **Pub**lisher (mdpub for short) helps republishing articles of personal blogs on
different Markdown based logging platforms. It takes single Markdown files which contains the a
post, then updates all links and lastly publishes the article again on Medium or dev.to or on both.

This is a helpful tool for anyone who wants to publish posts on their own website but still want to
get effects of publishing on other platforms to become more known.

CRC Check is a tool to validate CRC32 hashsum within file names. It scans the current directory for
any files that contain a hash, calculates the hash from their content and compares both hashes to
verify the content wasn't modified.

**[ ü§ñ Android/Kotlin ‚Ä¢ [Repository][beatfly_repo] ]**

BeatFly is a university project that showcases an application for a radio station. It doesn't have
a server to communicate with, so it emulates one acting like a fully working app. Main features
include playing music (obviously) and reviewing and wishing songs.

This app uses the latest Android features (at time of creation) and is completely written in
üçµ Kotlin. Among the used libraries are AndroidX, Dagger, Moshi, Glide and others.
